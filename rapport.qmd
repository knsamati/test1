## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(labelled)
library(gt)

df <- read_rds("mydf.rds")

df <-  df |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  remove_labels() |> 
  select(3:4)



df |> 
  gt()

```
